                                            As is the case with any new technology product, the cost of a Pocket PC
                                            was substantial during it’s early release. For approximately $700.00,

                                            These days, customers are finding that prices have become much more
                                            reasonable now that the newness is wearing off. For approximately

                                            capabilities as a modern PC. These handy little devices allow
                                            individuals to retrieve and store e-mail messages, create a contact
                                            file, coordinate appointments, surf the internet, exchange text messages
                                            and more. Every product that is labeled as a Pocket PC must be
                                            accompanied with specific software to operate the unit and must feature
                                            a touchscreen and touchpad.

                                            As is the case with any new technology product, the cost of a Pocket PC
                                            was substantial during it’s early release. For approximately $700.00,
                                            consumers could purchase one of top-of-the-line Pocket PCs in 2003.
                                            These days, customers are finding that prices have become much more
                                            reasonable now that the newness is wearing off. For approximately
                                            $350.00, a new Pocket PC can now be purchased.
